# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description 

This project creates an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

* AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
* I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
* SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Goals

* GIVEN I need a new, secure password
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password
* THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria
* THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password
* THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
* THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt
* THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered
* THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated
* THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
